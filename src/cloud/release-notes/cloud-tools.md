## What else do we want to include on this page?

Maybe this page could provide information about service operations type changes, or other updates that affect Cloud that might not be tied to a specific Magento release-- for example, news about changes to the Fastly extension, New Relic, or Blackfire or service operations changes.

The information would be more a summary of updates with links to relevant documentation that provide more information.
